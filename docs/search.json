    "text": "My research interests span a broad spectrum within the field of statistics, encompassing statistical machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and ensemble methods. Over the years, I have been actively involved in the development of statistical models tailored for predictive tasks. Specifically, my focus lies in extending Bayesian Additive Regression Trees models (BART) to address various situations where model assumptions may not always hold true or can be expanded. Additionally, I am intrigued by the development of models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), where I explore ways to adapt them to ensemble approaches and investigate the impact and influence of novel kernel functions. My applied statistics focus is diverse, ranging from demographic data to image and signal processing, all with the overarching goal of achieving predictive outcomes."

    "text": "This R package, available on CRAN as the \\(\\texttt{randomMachines}\\) package, implements a novel ensemble method employing Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as base learners. This powerful ensemble model is designed for both classification (Ara et al., 2021) and regression (Ara et al., 2021) problems, offering versatility and robust performance across different datasets compared with other consolidated methods, such as Random Forests (Maia et al., 2021) .\nTo install it only need to run\ninstall.packages(randomMachines)\n\n\n\nA R implementation, built on \\(\\texttt{C++}\\) and \\(\\texttt{Rcpp}\\), extends the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees using Gaussian Processes. This extension was developed by myself, Keefe Murphy, and Andrew Parnell. Further details about the statistical model are presented in the paper titled: “GP-BART: A novel Bayesian additive regression trees approach using Gaussian processes,” published in the Computational & Data Analysis journal.\nThe repository can be found at: https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/gpbart, and to install it, you only need to run:\ndevtools::install_github(\"MateusMaiaDS/gpbart\")"
