# About me

::: justify
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Maynooth University, specializing in the advancement of Bayesian Statistical Learning models, with a specific emphasis on extending Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). I obtained my master degree in Statistics in February of 2020 at the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, defending my dissertation entitled: "Random Machines: The Random Kernel Space for constructing a Support Vector Machine Enseble" where I proposed an innovative ensemble method utilizing support vector machines. I also hold an bachelor degree in Geophysics obtained in 2018 by the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.
